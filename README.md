# Static-Practice-E-Comm-Website
This practice website showcases static content, meaning it does not rely on dynamic server-side processing or database interaction. Instead, it features pre-designed product pages, a shopping cart interface, and checkout functionalities, all implemented using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS.

To open the website go to index page and click on it and it will open on chrome. Further if anyone wants to check the coding simply left click on the pages and open with VS Code to check the coded files. Thankyou
